  "aboutMe": "I'm a 23 year old Software Development student from Tampere. My studies will be finished in fall 2020, and I'm looking for a suitable position to start my career as a developer. Among my studies I have also studied a large variety of skills and technologies from data visualization to machine learning, and I'm planning to continue my studies with a master's degree. My main interests are in the fields of Front-end and Full stack development, but I am always willing to venture out of my technological comfort zone.",
  "aboutCareer": "My main strengths are modern web technologies such as React, but I have also played around with Angular and Vue extensively. I'm constantly learning more about these technologies, and bringing my learnings to fruition in form of projects. Besides JavaScript, I also have solid foundations in both Java and C++. Later in my career I see myself specializing more in data analytics and machine learning, but I'd always like to have a visual element in my work.",
  "aboutLife": "Outside work I have a long history in sports, mainly matrial arts. At the moment my sport of choice is BJJ, in wich I also compete from time to time. The mentality I have obtained from martial arts also carries over to my mentality as an employee: I always remember to bring my sense of humor to work but also take my work seriously, and I take responsibility in shipping the best product possible.",
